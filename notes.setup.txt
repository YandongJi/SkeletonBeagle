----------------------

2. Setup Cloud9, and add necessary files/tools
changing cloud9 default trajectory: use soft link to /home/debian
ln -s /home/debian debian

3. setup WiFi
network:
(to work with passwd, should use agent on)

connmanctl> tether wifi off
connmanctl> enable wifi
connmanctl> scan wifi
connmanctl> services 
(at this point you should see your network appear along with other stuff, in my case it was "AR Crystal wifi_f45eab2f1ee1_6372797774616c_managed_psk") 
[connmanctl> agent on]
connmanctl> connect wifi_f45eab2f1ee1_6372797774616c_managed_psk
connmanctl> quit

ping google.com to check

4. update software packages
git clone https://github.com/ucb-ee192/SkeletonBeagle

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install zip
sudo apt-get install gdb
sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev

for PRU debugger:
git clone https://github.com/RRvW/prudebug-rl

5. on laptop, open wifi connnection to BeagleBone-CC5D in network settings
ssh -l debian 192.168.8.1

6. robot too heavy with battery and beagle bone, even at 40% PWM (8V)
