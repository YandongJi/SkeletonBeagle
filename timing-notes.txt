Timing Notes for Debian on BeagleBone Blue

https://plone.lucidsolutions.co.nz/hardware/raspberry-pi/3/disable-unwanted-raspbian-services
# systemctl disable avahi-daemon
# systemctl stop avahi-daemon

Is apache2 server needed?

Is variation less when not running Cloud9?

avahi-daemon is using lost of cycles?

debian irq/72-wl18xx: wireless interface?

netstat -tap |grep LISTEN.

not running cloud9
htop for 11 hours: TIME+
rc_battery_monitor: 1:05.41
/usr/sbin/apache2 -k start: 4 processes, each at 0:31.95
sshd: debian@pts/4: 0:14.93
avahi-daemon: 0:05.00
/usr/bin/nodejs server.js: 37.79, 10.64, 

turn off wifi:
connmanctl> services
connmanctl> disable wifi

./TimingTest: use sort on logfile.csv to find maximum delay.
sort -n --key=3 logfile.csv
worst case = 4496 us at tick 576

Here I did
sudo kill -9 {avahi-daemon, rc_battery_monitor, apache2}.

After boot, before killing any jobs:
max 10554 us, 20x > 5000 us

Closing cloud9:
max 4050.906, 4x > 300 us

killing rc_battery_monitor:
max 4230, 2899, 15X > 200 us

no htop:
max 4577, 3564, 2578, 18X > 200 us

disable wifi:
max 2625, 17X > 200 us

kill apache2:
max 2273, 5X > 200 us, 20X > 100 us

WATCH OUT- killed too many processes, and could not connect to BBB through network...
Had to reflash!
